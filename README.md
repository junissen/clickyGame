React Click Game for HW15 UMN Coding Bootcamp

The purpose of this game is to click on images and increase your score. The images shuffle between each click, so you'll have to remember which image you have already clicked on. If you click on the same one twice, YOU LOSE, and your score returns to 0. The images are set to gifs from Broad City, however you can generate your own gifs to play with using the search bar.

This application uses React.js and API requests. The application can either be downloaded from github and run by changing the file path to the hosting directory in the CLI and typing the following: 

`
yarn start
`

This will generate the application in a browser window. The application is also hosted by GitHub Pages at https://junissen.github.io/clickyGame/.
